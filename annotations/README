Annotations:

CG islands obtained from UCSC track download

Gene GTF file from:

wget ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/gencode/Gencode_human/release_24/gencode.v24.annotation.gtf.gz

TSS Generation:

Fed gunzipped file into this awk script: https://github.com/sdjebali/MakeGencodeTSS

Took resulting gff and converted to bed (1-0 start location, removed some columns) 
Also calculated promoter region (2kb upstream, 200bp downstream, strand aware) using GenomicRanges
