# methylation-analysis

The code in this repository is the pipeline used for our nanopore methylation [paper](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/04/04/047142). The main script is `pipeline.make` which starts from data downloaded from the ENA and generates all figures and tables in the `results/` directory.
